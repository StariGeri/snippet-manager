# Running the app

After cloning the repo, there is a few things to do. The app uses 3rd party solution for authentication and for the database.

1. run `npm install`

2) Create a .env file and get the necessary variables (there is a template at the bottom of this .md file)
   - Sign up on https://clerk.com/ and create a new project. Copy the env variables.
   - Sign up on https://vercel.com/ and create a new project, then create a Vercel Postgres database (storage tab). Copy the environment variables.
3) Generate the database tables with `npm generate` and then migrate the changes with `npm migrate`.
4) (Optional) Drizzle provides a GUI for watching the database. You can run drizzle studio with `npx tsx scripts/seed.ts`
5) Run the app with `npm run dev`.
6) ðŸŽ‰ Aaaand that is it! The app is running on http://localhost:3000
